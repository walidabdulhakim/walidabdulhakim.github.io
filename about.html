                <p> Hi Guys I'm Walid Abdul Hakim, a computer engineering graduate with a global perspective. 
                    From Afghanistan and having completed my studies at Istanbul Kultur University / Turkey,

                    of purpose and an unwavering commitment to making a positive difference in the field of computing.
                     During my educational journey, I have consistently sharpened my abilities in rapid learning and 
                     assimilating intricate concepts, allowing me to contribute effectively to collaborative projects. 
                     I thrive on the thrill of problem-solving and exhibit meticulous attention to detail to ensure the
                      delivery of impeccable work. Adapting effortlessly and possessing a quick learning curve, I thrive
                       in both team-oriented settings and independent endeavors, perpetually embodying a diligent and 
                       tenacious spirit. With expertise encompassing diverse programming languages such as C, C++, Java, 
                       and Python, complemented by hands-on experience in software development and algorithm design, 
                       I possess the ability to breathe life into innovative solutions. I eagerly look forward to leveraging
                        my skills and knowledge to tackle challenging projects, leaving a lasting impact in the ever-evolving
