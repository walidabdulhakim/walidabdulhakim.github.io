                <h1>Biosignals-Based Latent Factor Decoding for emotion detection using a Variational Autoencoder</h1>
                <p>The project focused on developing an emotion detection system using biosignals like EGG, where we aimed to create a
                    comprehensive representation of an individual's emotional state using deep learning, Machine learning with the help of
                    Matlab and Python </p>
                <h1>Machine Learning Based Android Malware Detection: A State of Art</h1>
                <p> An in-depth review paper on various Machine Learning based Android malware detection which aims to provide important
                    insights into the strengths and limits of different machine learning based Android malware detection and highlight
                    opportunities for future works.</p>
                <h1>Apexia : Blockchain Based Storage</h1>
                <p> APXEIA: Decentralized Storage App is a blockchain-based decentralized storage which helps users to store their files and
                    share public. Decentralized storage system is the concept of storing files online by splitting them into encrypted objects and
                    delegating them on multiple nodes on distributed networks. Thus, it is among most preferred ways on storing files due to itsâ€™

                <h1>Car Auction Portal </h1>
                <p> The project was a proper fully working online auction website which allowed the user to sell and buy cars. This web site
                    allowed users to search and bid on cars of their liking and need. The project was developed using JavaScript, C#, HTML had a
                    database (Microsoft SQL) connected to it where it stored all the registered users, actions, bits, admins information.

                <h1>Heart Disease Analysis using Machine Learning</h1>
                <p> The objective of this project was to discover ways of utilizing ML strategies for analysis and forecasts utilizing existing dataset
                    on heart disease. While discovering on how they can be utilized together in a process of changing over crude
                    data to viable decision-making information leading to a much better predictions for heart disease.</p>
